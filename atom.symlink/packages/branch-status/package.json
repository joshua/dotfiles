It also inserts\na link to the branch's pull request if there is one.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Make sure atom has your github token. Pretty sure you'll want to run `api login`.\n2. Install the package.\n3. Hit `ctrl-s` to update the branch status.\n\n## Todo\n\n- ~~Super lame that you have to hit `ctrl-s` but I have no idea how to make things\npoll. Help. Patches welcome.~~ Oh cool this works now.\n- I'd also like to be able to click the build and go to the `target_url`.\n\n### Here's what it looks like right now:\n\n![](http://cloud.patnakajima.com/image/3t422y0p2S45/Gemfile%20-%20_Users_nakajima_github_github.png)\n",
