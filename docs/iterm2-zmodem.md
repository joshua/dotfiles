ZModem integration for iTerm 2
------------------------------

This script can be used to automate ZModem transfers from your OSX desktop to a server that can run `lrzsz` (in theory, any machine 
that supports SSH), and vice-versa.

The minimum supported iTerm2 version is 1.0.0.20120108

Troubleshooting
---------------

 * Sending a directory may fail: this is a known issue
 * If you are using `tmux` or some other terminal multiplexer (ie: `screen`), try using the `-e` option to `sz` and/or `rz` on your server to force escaping of more characters during transmission.
 * This tool may also fail if you are using `expect` or `rlogin` as it expects a mostly-clean 8-bit connection between the two parties.

Setup
-----

0. Install lrzsz on OSX: `brew install lrzsz`
1. Save the `iterm2-send-zmodem.sh` and `iterm2-recv-zmodem.sh` scripts in `/usr/local/bin/`
2. Set up Triggers in iTerm 2 like so:
[How to Create a Trigger](https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-triggers.html)

<pre>
    Regular expression: rz waiting to receive.\*\*B0100
    Action: Run Silent Coprocess
    Parameters: /usr/local/bin/iterm2-send-zmodem.sh
    Instant: checked

    Regular expression: \*\*B00000000000000
    Action: Run Silent Coprocess
    Parameters: /usr/local/bin/iterm2-recv-zmodem.sh
    Instant: checked
</pre>

To send a file to a remote machine:

1. Type `rz` on the remote machine
2. Select the file(s) on the local machine to send
3. Wait for the coprocess indicator to disappear

The receive a file from a remote machine

1. Type `sz filename1 filename2 â€¦ filenameN` on the remote machine
2. Select the folder to receive to on the local machine
3. Wait for the coprocess indicator to disappear
