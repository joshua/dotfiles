# Highlight Selected

Double click on a word to highlight it throughout the open file.

This is something hacky I've put together as I missed the functionality that
Sublime gave.

Some code and has been taken from Atom's
  [find and replace](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace) package

Please log any issues and pull requests are more than welcome!
