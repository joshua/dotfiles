# Fancy New File package

Fancy New File is a plugin for Github's Atom text editor that gives you a
handy dialog (accessible via `alt-cmd-n`) to open or create new files and
directory trees by typing a relative path, with bash-like autocomplete support.

Inspired by sukoroda`s
[Advanced New File](https://github.com/skuroda/Sublime-AdvancedNewFile)
for Sublime Text.
