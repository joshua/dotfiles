# atom-branch-status package

Show the current status of your branch using the GitHub status API. It also inserts
a link to the branch's pull request if there is one.

## Usage

1. Make sure atom has your github token. Pretty sure you'll want to run `api login`.
2. Install the package.
3. Hit `ctrl-s` to update the branch status.

## Todo

- ~~Super lame that you have to hit `ctrl-s` but I have no idea how to make things
poll. Help. Patches welcome.~~ Oh cool this works now.
- I'd also like to be able to click the build and go to the `target_url`.

### Here's what it looks like right now:
